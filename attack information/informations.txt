Beast Attack :;

	BEAST has three conditions that must be met for this attack to take place:

	JavaScript or applet injection into the same origin of the web site
	Network sniffing of the connection must be possible
	A vulnerable version of SSL must be used which is using a block cipher

Compression side channel attacks:
	Breach :v
		Be served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression
		Reflect user-input in HTTP response bodies
		Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodies
